# csgA-pilC-wt-matlab
data and codes for figures in the paper are in 'csgA-pilC-wt-matlab/data&codes for figures/'. Data in folder 'csgA','WT','pilC' are used for multiple figures. Data in folder 'Fig1' to 'Fig10' are used only for that figure. 

Due to the size limit of Github, the original experimental images are not uploaded here but on Dryad at 'doi:10.5061/dryad.1rn8pk0qc'
The analization code for experimental images can be found at https://github.com/cottersci/PNAS2017.

For closed loop simulation without any mixture of datasets, i.e., simulation for figure 5,6,7, the code can also be found at https://github.com/cottersci/PNAS2017/tree/master/Code/Models/ClosedLoopModel
